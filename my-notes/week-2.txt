Recalling on scalars and vectors from week-1
Vectors:
(i) magnitude and direction
(ii) displacement
(iii) velocity
Scalars:
(i) Magnitude
(ii) distance
(iii) speed

Problem:
400 metres running finished in 49.11 seconds.
What is average velocity (Vav)?
Magnitude of the average velocity (Vav) => ???
401 m / 49.11 sec => 8.2 m/s

Any change in velocity despite speed remaining as constant is acceleration.

Motion of straight line:
Average velocity (Vav) = Displacement (x) / Time (t)

Average velocity for small interval = Delta x / Delta t

Problem:
What is magnitude of average velocity between t=0 and t=1.6 ?
Time in x-axis
Displacement in y-axis
Solution:
Vav = x - x0 / t
=> [x(1.6) - x(0.0)] cm / (1.6-0.0) sec
=> 105 - 30 cm / 1.6 sec => 47 cm
v(t) is the slope of x(t)
x = x0 + vt

Xp = Xp0 + Vp t
Xk = Xk0 + Vk t
t = (Xk0 - Xp0) / (Vp0 - Vk0)

If 0.50hours delay from M and J is 0.50 hours ahead
t = [(Vm) / (Vm - Vj)] x 0.5 hours
Meeting point = Vj x t

Slope = Rise / Run
The slighter accleration occurs, the faster the speed increases.

Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity.

Units of velocity = m s^-1/s = m s^-2

constant acceleration 
Velocity, v = v0 + at
Initial displacement, x = x0 + v0 t + 1/2 a t^2

Relating velocity, acceleration and displacement
Problem:
How far do you travel while you accelerate from 3.0 m s^-1 to 8.0 ms s^-1
with constant acceleration a = 2.0 m s^-2?
Given v, v0, a. Find (x - x0). Eliminate t.
v = v0 + at => t = (v - v0)/a --- (1)
x = x0 + v0 t + 1/2 a t^2 --- (2)
Substituting (1) in (2),
x - x0 = v0 x [[v-v0]/a] + a/2 [[v-v0]/a]^2
2a(x-x0) = v^2 - v0^2 --- (3)

Relative Motion
V = Vf + V'
where V = Vobject with respect to ground
Vf = Vframe with respect to ground
V' = Vobject with respect to frame

Problem:
Consider the following convention - north, south, east, west.
Vf = velocity of moving frame with respect to ground
V' = velocity of the object with respect to moving frame
V = velocity of the object with respect to ground
If Vf is the velocity of the wooden plate,
then what is the approximate direction of Vf?
Answer: West
