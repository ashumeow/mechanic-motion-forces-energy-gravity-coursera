Recalling on scalars and vectors from week-1
Vectors:
(i) magnitude and direction
(ii) displacement
(iii) velocity
Scalars:
(i) Magnitude
(ii) distance
(iii) speed

Problem:
400 metres running finished in 49.11 seconds.
What is average velocity (Vav)?
Magnitude of the average velocity (Vav) => ???
401 m / 49.11 sec => 8.2 m/s

Any change in velocity despite speed remaining as constant is acceleration.

Motion of straight line:
Average velocity (Vav) = Displacement (x) / Time (t)

Average velocity for small interval = Delta x / Delta t

Problem:
What is magnitude of average velocity between t=0 and t=1.6 ?
Time in x-axis
Displacement in y-axis
Solution:
Vav = x - x0 / t
=> [x(1.6) - x(0.0)] cm / (1.6-0.0) sec
=> 105 - 30 cm / 1.6 sec => 47 cm
v(t) is the slope of x(t)
x = x0 + vt

Xp = Xp0 + Vp t
Xk = Xk0 + Vk t
t = (Xk0 - Xp0) / (Vp0 - Vk0)

If 0.50hours delay from M and J is 0.50 hours ahead
t = [(Vm) / (Vm - Vj)] x 0.5 hours
Meeting point = Vj x t

Slope = Rise / Run
The slighter accleration occurs, the faster the speed increases.

Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity.

Units of velocity = m s^-1/s = m s^-2

constant acceleration 
Velocity, v = v0 + at
Initial displacement, x = x0 + v0 t + 1/2 a t^2
