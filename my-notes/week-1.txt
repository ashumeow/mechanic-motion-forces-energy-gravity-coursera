Clouds of Magellan = galaxy containing billions of stars

Democritus and Ajivika

Bottle of water into 4 glasses of equal amount, 
One of the glass divided into 4 equal parts,
One of those part divided into 4 equal parts.
How many times can this process be repeated bearing atleast 1 molecule in each portion?
Between 20 and 50

Human brain uses binary signals with typical voltages of approximately 0.1 volt which is rougly between 0.03V and 0.3V

1 year = 365.24 days
=> 31, 556, 736 seconds

14 billion years => 14 x 10^9
=> 4.417943e+17 seconds
=> 4.4 x 10^17 seconds for the age of the universe

If it's 13.8 billion years, then the answer comes as 4.35 x 10^17 seconds

Speed = Distance / Time

1 meters per second = 3.6 kilometers per hour

World record for solar cars without batteries => 88.7 kilometers per hour

1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers

=> 88.7 / 1.60934 => 55.1 miles per hour

1 inch = 2.54 centimetres

Speed of the Earth => 30 kilometers per second => 460 meters per second
=> 460 x 3.6 => 1,656 kilometers per hour

radius of the earth = 6.371 x 10^6 meters

Nautical miles = 60 miles

Speed of light = 2.99792458 x 10^8 meters per second

Speed of the Earth = distance travelled in 1 orbit / time taken for 1 orbit
=> 2 x PI x r / 1 year
r = 8.3 mins x 60sec x speed of light / 1000 meters
1 year = 365.24 x 24 hours
=> 1,10,000 kilometers per hour

Scalar : Example- Speed
Vector : Example- Velocity
A vector can not be equal to a scalar.
Two vertical lines equals to the magnitude of the vector.
The magnitude of the vector is indeed a scalar.
The magnitude of the velocity must have distance of unit time, which is a scalar.
Whereas the east direction is a displacement, which is a vector.
Scalar has magnitudes of sides, but no directions.
But, vector has both magnitude and direction.

If the directions of vector A is 5 meters north and vector B is 5 meters east, then their magnitude will be 1. (i.e. unit vectors)

If the directions of vector A is 5 meters north and vector B is 5 meters north-east with north-east displacement of A + B, 
then the magnitude of the displacement is the square root of A square + B square 
=> square root ((5^2) + (5^2)) => 10

A - B => A + (-B)

number of grains = volume of sand / volume of grain
=> length x breadth x depth / (size)^3
=> 400m x 40m x 3m / (3 x 10^-4 m)^3
=> 2 x 10^15 => 10^15

Which one is greater?
The number of grains of sand on the beach? (or)
The number of atoms in each grain of sand?
It is the number of grains of sand on the beach

number of cells in human = volume of human / volume of cell
=> mass of human / (density of water x volume of cell)
=> 100 kg / 1000 kg m^-3 x (10^-5 m)^3
=> 1 kg / 10 kg m^-3 x 10^-15 m^3
=> 1 kg / 10^-14 m^3
=> 10^14

number of atoms = mass of grain / mass of atom
=> volume x density / mass of atom
=> [(2 x 10^-11 m^3) x (2600 kg m^-3)] x [6 x 10^23] / 0.02 kg
=> 10^18

radius = diameter / 2

volume of a cylinder = PI x height x radius^2

Density of a cylinder = mass / volume

1 inch = 25.4 mm or 0.0254 m
1 foot = 12 inches
1 mile = 5,280 feet
1 meter = 1000 mm
1 centimeter = 0.01 m or 10 mm
5 feet 3 inches = 63 inches or 1600mm or 160 cm

1 horsepower = 745.7 watts
1 watt = 0.01 kilowatt

Atomic volume occupied by nucleus = volume of nucleus / volume of atom
=> [4 PI (10^-13)^3] / [4 PI (10^-8)^3]
=> 10^-15
